# Malware-URL-Lookup-Exercise
Note:
I am not familiar with the python flask framework or other python coding and naming conventions, 
but this repo has implemented functionality required by the write-up.

File:
main.py: including the function that can response a specific api request
/service/DB/simple_db_manager.py: a db manager class that emulates db operations for malware urls
/test/DB/test_simple_db_manager.py: a test class where I write unit test cases for functions in simple_db_manager.py

Install:
1. Clone the repo
2. cd to the working directory
3. Install package by running the command 'pip install -r requirements.txt'

Test the service:
1. Start the python flask server by running the command 'python main.py'.
    main.py will automatically populate the in-memory db. It will save urls google.com, linkedin.com, bestbuy.com, and walmart.com.
2. Open any browser
3. Try a few urls:
    a. localhost:8080/v1/urlinfo?url=google.com
    b. localhost:8080/v1/urlinfo?url=meta.com
    c. localhost:8080/v1/urlinfo/
